An interactive backtesting tool that helps you analyze how a Bitcoin rebalancing strategy would have performed historically. Test various allocation ratios and rebalancing thresholds to optimize your crypto portfolio strategy.

## üíπ The 50:50 Rebalancing Strategy

A simple but powerful portfolio management approach that can potentially outperform buy-and-hold strategies during volatile market conditions.

### How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Split your capital equally: 50% in Bitcoin and 50% in fiat (USD or THB)

2. **Daily Monitoring**
   - Check if your Bitcoin allocation has drifted from the target ratio
   - Target allocation: 50%
   - Rebalance threshold: 5%

3. **Rebalancing Rules**
   - If Bitcoin grows to ‚â•55% of your portfolio ‚Üí **SELL** Bitcoin to return to 50:50
   - If Bitcoin falls to ‚â§45% of your portfolio ‚Üí **BUY** Bitcoin to return to 50:50 
   - If Bitcoin stays between 45-55% ‚Üí No action needed

4. **Long-Term Benefits**
   - Automatically sells portions during bull markets (capturing profits)
   - Automatically buys during bear markets (buying the dip)
   - Reduces emotional decision-making
   - Helps manage volatility and risk

## üß† Why Rebalancing Works

Rebalancing is a contrarian strategy that potentially allows you to:

1. **Buy Low, Sell High** - Automatically enforces this discipline
2. **Reduce Risk** - Prevents any single asset from dominating your portfolio
3. **Remove Emotion** - Takes the guesswork out of "timing the market"
4. **Maximize Volatility Harvesting** - Takes advantage of Bitcoin's famous price swings

## üìä Sample Results

Based on historical data, a 50:50 BTC/USD portfolio with a 5% rebalance threshold has shown:

- Reduced maximum drawdown compared to buy-and-hold
- Competitive returns with lower volatility
- Higher risk-adjusted returns in many market conditions
